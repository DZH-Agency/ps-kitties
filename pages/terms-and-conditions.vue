        <p><b>A.</b>	Upon Purchase You Own the NFT. Each PsychoKitty is an NFT with its Art on the Crypto.org blockchain. When you purchase an NFT, we grant you the rights to the underlying Art, as specified herein. Ownership of the NFT is mediated </p>
        <p><b>B.</b>	Personal Use. Subject to your continued compliance with these Terms, for so long as you own your PsychoKitty, PK grants you a worldwide, royalty-free license to use, copy, and display the purchased Art, along with any extensions that you choose to create or use, solely for the following purposes: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>for your own personal, non-commercial use;</li>
          <li>as part of a marketplace that permits the display, purchase and sale of your PsychoKitty / NFT, for so long as you own your PsychoKitty, provided that the marketplace cryptographically verifies each PsychoKitty owner’s rights to display the Art for their PsychoKitty to ensure that only the actual owner can display the Art; or </li>
          <li>as part of a third party website or application that permits the inclusion, involvement, or participation of your PsychoKitty, for so long as you own your PsychoKitty, provided that the website/application cryptographically verifies each PsychoKitty owner’s rights to display the Art for their PsychoKitty to ensure that only the actual owner can display the Art, and provided that the Art is no longer visible once the owner of the PsychoKitty leaves the website/application.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>C.</b>	Commercial Use. Subject to your continued compliance with these Terms, for so long as you own your PsychoKitty, PK grants you an unlimited, worldwide license to use, copy, and display the purchased Art (hereinafter the <b>“Commercial Use”</b>). Examples of such Commercial Use would e.g. be the use of the Art to produce and sell merchandise products (T-Shirts etc.) displaying copies of the Art or by licensing the exact, unmodified PsychoKitty or PsychoMolly to a writer looking for an artwork for a book. For the sake of clarity, nothing in this Section will be deemed to restrict you from (i) owning or operating a marketplace that permits the use and sale of PsychoKitty generally, for so long as you own your PsychoKitty, provided that the marketplace cryptographically verifies each PsychoKitty owner’s rights to display the Art for their PsychoKitty to ensure that only the actual owner can display the Art; (ii) owning or operating a third party website or application that permits the inclusion, involvement, or participation of PsychoKitty generally, for so long as you own your PsychoKitty, provided that the third party website or application cryptographically verifies each PsychoKitty owner’s rights to display the Art for their PsychoKitty to ensure that only the actual owner can display the Art, and provided that the Art is no longer visible once the owner of the purchased PsychoKitty leaves the website/application; or (iii) earning revenue from any of the foregoing.</p>
        <p><b>D.</b>	You acknowledge and understand that by purchasing PsychoKitty you are not acquiring any equity or other ownership or profit-sharing interest in PK or Ugonzo, or any of their affiliates or any brand or other business venture.</p>
        <p><b>E.</b>	For the avoidance of doubt, nothing herein gives you any rights to (i) create and sell derivatives of the PsychoKitty art, or (iii) distort or otherwise modify PsychoKitty or any of its parts, its colors, design, etc. (ii) use any trademarks, brand names, logos or other intellectual property rights belonging to PK/Ugonzo.</p>
        <p><b>F.</b>	You may not, and may not allow any third party to use name, pseudonym and/or likeness of PsychoKitty authors/artists, PK/Ugonzo brand name, logos or other IP and assets in any kind of activities that may lead to misleading costumers or/and false association, false endorsement, etc. </p>
        <p><b>G.</b>	Notwithstanding anything contrary, PK/Ugonzo retains all rights necessary to exploit any PsychoKitty in any commercial and non-commercial way, and build new partnerships and collaborations with regard to any PsychoKitty.  Unless Ugonzo permits otherwise in writing, you are not entitled to any royalties or any other proceedings coming from such commercialization, partnerships and collaborations. You hereby irrevocably waive right to make any claim against PK/Ugonzo or any third party authorized by PK/Ugonzo to exploit PsychoKitty based on activities, partnerships and collaborations permitted or directly executed by PK/Ugonzo. </p>
        <p><b>H.</b>	PK IP.  Other than the rights to the Art, nothing herein gives you any rights to any other trademarks or other intellectual property rights belonging to PK including, without limitation, to PK/Ugonzo, PsychoKitty and the associated logos.
